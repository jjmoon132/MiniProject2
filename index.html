                <h2>Dataset Selection</h2>
                <p>In choosing a dataset to analyze we wanted to pick a topic that is both interesting and applicable to all. We decided to use data on movies from Kaggle. Although we’ve all watched a movie at one point or another, there are many trends about different genres, distributors, and movie performances that the average person is not likely to be aware of. This dataset provides insight on many of these relationships, trends, and information.</p>

                <h2>Data Filtering</h2>
                <p>Before diving into the data, we looked through to see if there were any missing values that would impact our analysis. We found that data prior to 1970 and after 2010 was lacking, so we decided to focus on the time period in between these two years, since it contains the most data.</p>
                <p>We also found that some of the data for the US DVD Sales and the movie Running Time was missing, so we were careful with using this data in our analysis. Instead, we chose to focus our analysis on the data for the movie genres, release date, distributors, IMDB rating, US Gross, and Worldwide Gross.</p>

                <h2>Visualization Generation</h2>
                <p>We first chose to plot the number of movies in each major drama against time so that we could see how the most common movie genres have changed throughout the years. As expected, there is an increase in the number of overall movies, starting around 1993. Additionally, drama and comedy movies were consistently the most common, since they had the largest number of movies year after year.</p>

            <div class="column right">

        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column left">
                <p>The results sparked a curiosity about how different movie genres perform, in terms of earnings. We then decided to compare different movie genres and their total US Gross values. Again, we see that drama and comedy are two of the best performing movie genres, in addition to action and adventure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column right">
                <img src="chart2.png">

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column left">
                <p>Next, the data around production budgets was intriguing, since we would expect recent movies to have different budgets than older movies. We decided to analyze the change in production budgets by plotting the sum of the production budgets each year. We see that starting around 1994, there was a dramatic increase in production budgets. We also found that movie productions appear to have peaked in 2005, with a sum of over $7 billion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column right">

        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column left">
                <p>Lastly, we decided to dive deeper into the US Gross and Worldwide Gross data. We first decided to compare the average IMDB ratings to the average US Gross data. Then, we broke down data even more by splitting the values up based on the movie genres. When analyzing the visualization, we see that the highest IMDB rated genre actually has the lowest average US Gross. The highest average US Gross had a IMDB rating that falls roughly in the middle of the the range of all of the genres. We can conclude that there is minimal relationship between IMDB ratings and US Gross data of different movie genres. In this visualization, you are able to filter by the distributor of the movie, so it is interesting to select major producers, such as Disney, and see what their best performing movies are in terms of both ratings and average US gross revenue. Through clicking on Disney, you can see that they are similar to other distributors in that they make the most money on adventure movies, but they also perform much better than others on musicals, romantic comedies, and thrillers. They also tend to have higher ratings for every genre than other distributors besides horror movies, which they receive an average rating of 4.5 for. </p>

                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>Through our data, we discovered that the budgets and number of movies produced drastically increased in the mid 1990’s, which we attribute to the rise of modern cinemas and VHS, as it provided more opportunities to generate revenue. Furthermore, we discovered that although Drama and Comedy movies tend to be the most successful in terms of revenue, they also often receive bad ratings. This seems to be indicative of how well they are advertised through trailers and commercials, which entice viewers, but then the movie is lacking substance, so it is not well received by critics and may leave the viewers disappointed. It is often less popular movies that make less money that receive the higher ratings like documentaries, which typically are very well produced, but they also are only for a specific audience, resulting in high ratings but low revenue. Lastly, we found that certain producers and distributors definitely specialize in producing certain genres of movies, such as Disney and its huge success with musicals, while other producers seemed to struggle with them. Another example is Paramount Pictures, Sony, and Universal, who all have more success in generating revenue on action movies than the rest of the producers.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>Through this project, we learned a great deal about gathering data and analyzing it through the lens of a question, which was helpful in making effective visualizations. If you go into a dataset with no real question driving what you are looking for, you often end up just making graphs that mean nothing but look good. This project showed us how if you go in with a question and goal in mind, then the visualizations end up being both beautiful and telling a story, which makes for a better overall experience for the viewer, as they learn something from the data. We also learned about the difficulty of finding a good dataset for the specific question you want to address, as we had to adapt the dataset we selected in order to make it work and have the correct data that we wanted for the project, which took a lot more time than expected. Lastly, we learned how to use Tableau to make more effective and interactive visualizations, such as the last one where you can filter by producer in order to see their ratings and gross for each movie they produced, which allows the viewer to dive into the data, look at their favorite movies’ producers and think about how that movie that they love affects both the ratings and revenue. This experience makes the viewer truly digest the data and take information away from it, rather than just glancing at it quickly.
